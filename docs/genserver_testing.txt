GenServer (Generic Server) is one of the core building blocks in Elixir applications, implementing the actor model for concurrent state management. It gives us a notion of when GenServers shine:

Resource Management
When you need to manage connections or limited resources

Before diving into GenServer implementation, always reconsider if you need it. A key question is: "Does my process need to manage state over time or deal with inter-process coordination?" If the answer is no, then there’s likely a better approach available. Many problems can be solved with simple structs and functions, avoiding the overhead and complexity of a full GenServer.

GenServer overhead

defmodule CounterServer do


  use GenServer


  def start_link(initial_count) do

    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, initial_count, name: __MODULE__)

  end


  def init(initial_count), do: {:ok, initial_count}


  def increment, do: GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :increment)

  

  def handle_call(:increment, _from, count) do

    {:reply, count + 1, count + 1}

  end

end

This GenServer implementation comes with several forms of overhead:
You need to start and manage a long-running process
Each operation requires inter-process communication
You need to handle process supervision and recovery
Each process maintains its state in memory
You need to implement callbacks and handle the process lifecycle

In cases where nothing from above is required, go for a more straightforward implementation:
Simpler alternative

defmodule Counter do

  defstruct count: 0


  def increment(%Counter{count: count} = counter) do

    %Counter{counter | count: count + 1}

  end

end

Why Proper Design Matters:
“If you can’t test it, it’s not a good design.”
Kent Beck
Creator of Extreme programming

One of the first principles to keep in mind when working with GenServers is the importance of design. With proper design, testing GenServers becomes at least possible and at most easier while the overall complexity of an application decreases.

Common design flaws: 
Business Logic overload

The GenServer should act primarily as a coordinator, passing off complex business logic to external modules. By keeping GenServers thin, you can make testing easier, as the business logic can be tested independently of the process. Let's examine a common anti-pattern where business logic is directly embedded in the GenServer:
BL overload example

defmodule OrderProcessor do

  use GenServer


  def handle_call({:process_order, order}, _from, state) do

    # Complex business logic buried in GenServer

    validated_order = validate_order(order)

    total = calculate_total(validated_order)

    updated_inventory = update_inventory(validated_order)

    receipt = generate_receipt(validated_order, total)

    

    {:reply, receipt, Map.put(state, :inventory, updated_inventory)}

  end

  

  # Many private functions implementing business logic...

end

This implementation violates key principles of business logic separation. First, it creates testing complexity – business logic is trapped inside process management, each test requires process overhead, it's hard to test business rules in isolation, and difficult to simulate different business scenarios. 

Second, it introduces maintainability issues – business rules are mixed with infrastructure concerns, changes to business logic risk affecting process stability, it's hard to adapt as business rules evolve, and difficult to reuse logic across different interfaces. 

Third, there's context confusion – there's no clear separation between business and infrastructure layers, business rules become tied to process lifecycle, it's hard to implement new interfaces like API or CLI, and difficult to maintain consistent authorization. 

Here's a better approach that separates process management from business logic:
Better approach

defmodule OrderProcessor do

  use GenServer

  

  def handle_call({:process_order, order}, _from, state) do

    # GenServer only coordinates the process

    {:ok, receipt, updated_inventory} = OrderService.process_order(order, state)


    {:reply, receipt, Map.put(state, :inventory, updated_inventory)}

  end

end

Treating GenServers like OOP Objects (simple data management)

Misuse comes from developers with an object-oriented programming (OOP) background who treat GenServers like objects, trying to encapsulate state and business logic within them. This leads to overly complex and often untestable code.
Ignoring SRP

A well-designed GenServer should adhere to the single responsibility principle: it should focus on one task and do it well. This not only makes the GenServer more efficient, but it also simplifies testing. For example, in trading applications like those I work on, where real-time data streams need to be processed quickly, we assign each GenServer its specific task, such as processing orders or managing real-time market data. This helps ensure that no single GenServer becomes a bottleneck.
Lean on isolation and mocking for effective testing

Now that we've covered proper GenServer design – keeping them thin, avoiding business logic overload, and maintaining single responsibility – let's explore how these principles enable straightforward testing. When your GenServers are well-designed, testing becomes natural and follows two main strategies:
Isolated callback testing

When testing GenServers, you should apply a consistent strategy across different callbacks (handle_call, handle_cast, handle_info, ect). Testing these callbacks directly by calling them in isolation allows you to focus on the specific state transitions without the overhead of running a GenServer. This is particularly useful for simple tests where you need to validate that the correct state is returned for given inputs.
Live GenServer testing

For more complex interactions, such as timeouts or retries with external services, it’s often necessary to run the GenServer itself. Jose Valim established these testing strategies in his article about mocks and explicit contracts. Let's look at how to implement them:
Functional testing with live GenServer

When you deal with modules/services that you cannot control (or you don't want to control), you can wrap them into facades with explicit contracts and different adapters for different environments (test, dev, prod). Let's take a look at an example.

defmodule Mailer.Adapter do

  @callback send_email(to :: String.t(), subject :: String.t(), body :: String.t()) :: :ok

end


defmodule Mailer.Stub do

  @behaviour Mailer.Adapter


  def send_email(_to, _subject, _body), do: :ok

end


defmodule YourEmailService do

  @behaviour Mailer.Adapter


  def send_email(_to, _subject, _body) do

  # you actually send an email here using your email service

  end

end

Let's say we have a GenServer which sends an email after processing an order. By having an explicit contract, we can easily swap the implementation for testing purposes.
Case 1, when we don't need to swap the implementation

In that case, we can use the Stub implementation.

# somewhere in your test.exs file

config :my_app, :mailer, Mailer.Stub


defmodule OrderProcessor do

  use GenServer


  # in that case, Stub is baked into the GenServer, allowing us to focus on the business logic

  @mailer Application.compile_env(:my_app, :mailer)


  def handle_call({:process_order, order}, _from, state) do

    # ...

    @mailer.send_email(order.email, "Order Confirmation", "Thank you for your order!")

    # ...

  end

end

Case 2, when we NEED to swap the implementation

In that case, we could pass the implementation as an option to the GenServer so that details could be changed on the test level.

defmodule OrderProcessor do

  def start_link(opts) do

    mailer = Keyword.fetch!(opts, :mailer)

    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{mailer: mailer}, name: __MODULE__)

  end

  # ...

  def handle_call({:process_order, order}, _from, state) do

    # ...

    case state.mailer.send_email(order.email, "Order Confirmation", "Thank you for your order!") do

      :ok -> # ...

      {:error, reason} -> # ...

    end

    # ...

  end

end


defmodule FailingMailer do

  @behaviour Mailer.Adapter


  def send_email(_to, _subject, _body), do: {:error, "Failed to send email"}

end


describe "handle_call/3" do

  test "processes an order correctly" do

    # ...

    OrderProcessor.start_link(mailer: FailingMailer)

    # ...

  end

end

Conclusion

What have we learned about working with GenServers? 

First, not every problem needs a GenServer. Simple structs and functions are often enough – avoid the process management overhead unless you really need that persistent state or coordination between processes.

Second, when you do need a GenServer, keep it thin. Let it coordinate processes while keeping business logic elsewhere. You'll thank yourself later when testing and maintaining the code. Remember that mixing business rules with process management is a recipe for complexity.

Finally, testing well-designed GenServers doesn't have to be hard. Test simple state transitions by calling callbacks directly. Use proper contracts and dependency injection for more complex cases involving external services – either through configuration or runtime.

The bottom line? If testing feels difficult, your GenServer might be doing too much. Let that guide you toward better design decisions.
